Hello World

### W2

Question 1 Response: The r, g, and b variables are floats because color values
represented by decimal numbers between 0.0 and 1.0. Using floats allows for smooth and
gradual color transitions, which wouldn't be possible with integers, booleans or strings.

Question 2 Response: The _bounce variable is an integer because it keeps track of how
many times the ball has bounced, which is always a whole number. A float would be unncessary, a boolan
could only represent true or flase, and a string coulnd't be used for counting.

Question 3 Response: The error that appeared after Step X of Part 2 showed 
that there was a type of mismatch in the code. It revealed that the program
was trying to use float values where a Color type was expected, which
explained why the line didn't work. This helped show that the correct way to 
set a color is by using "Color (r, g, b)" instead of adding the numbers together.
